## Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
The app follows Model-View-ViewModel architecture:
- **Models**: SwiftData entities (Movie, Collection)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views with clear separation of concerns
- **Services**: Business logic and external API integration

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Barcode scanning or manual entry
2. **Processing**: IMDB API lookup for metadata
3. **Storage**: SwiftData local database
4. **Display**: SwiftUI views with real-time updates
5. **Export**: Photo library integration for poster storage
